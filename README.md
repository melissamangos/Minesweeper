#Minesweeper
For this project, I created a game of minesweeper using Python. This project is from grade 12 so please bear the noob code. :blush:

#About the Game
The goal of minesweeper is to finish the game without hitting a bomb. You must flag all the spaces you believe to contain bombs, and if you are correct, you win! <br>
To play the game you have to enter the number of rows, columns, and the number of bombs you would like to use. Once the game board is created you can either enter a square you want to reveal, or flag a square as a bomb. Revealed squares either contain a number that signals how many bombs are surronding them, or they contain a bomb. Revealing a bomb ends the game! Using the numbers given in each square you must figure out the locations of all the bombs.
